# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# To install
Download and unzip folder
Navigate into folder (you are now here, presumably)
Into the CL type: "npm install"
Type: "npm start"
Play game.
Try not to die.

# How to play
The goal is to uncover all the unmined tiles.
To uncover a tile, click on it.
If it is mined - you lose.
If it isn't mined, it will either reveal a mass of unmined tiles, or it will reveal a digit 1 through 8.
This number indicates how many mines directly surround the cell (hence the max of 8).
Use this as a guide/clue in how you uncover more cells.
Try not to die!
